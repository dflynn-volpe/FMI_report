# TODO for FMI_Waze_Assessment

Is the secure data commons on it's way to becoming a commons?
- What are the next steps for the SDC as a platform for cross-project analysis?
- Add to the Areas for Improvement for SDC section to finish it. 

What did we need to have?
- requesting access: getting FMI data access from Ed - DONE
- buckets: team bucket requested - DONE
- code repositories - DONE

- What hurdles have been overcome already by the SDC team? 
	+ Holes in the data being logged by SDC team,
	+ Confluence for sharing processes and documentation -- having a common place to document best practices for each data set. Suggestion for 'phase 3' from Billy: put a Confluence instance inside SDC (like GitLab)
	
What is scalable?

"Demonstrate the SDC's utility in gaining new insights"

Dan M questions: 
1) how did the SDC enable you (or not) to do your research comparing the two datasets
) how well did the SDC document and disclose the limitations of the datasets you chose to use?
3) how well did the SDC mediate access across enclaves of code (e.g., accessing the BTS/FMI work)


//what do you need to know in order to be an effective user of the "commons?"

Congestion and travel time reliability

Discuss user needs for cross project analysis: "As a user of the commons, I expect X..."

*Lessons learned*

# FMI Waze Hypothesis Document

Separate from the FMI_Waze_Assessment report, follows up on the pandemic response section of that report. 

Pandemic known patterns: 
	+ Less commuter traffic by at least 50%
	+ Less congestion as a result (90% reduction in jams)
	
pandemic consequences:

- Freight transportation spatial patterns: 
	+ More direct routes? This is a testable hypothesis. 
	+ This effect may be lagged (in terms of change in directness lagging behind the change in inertia)
	+ This effect may have inertia, in terms of change in directness persisting even after commuter-driven congestion returns to pre-pandemic levels. 

- Freight transportation trip efficiency:
	+ It is possible that long-haul vs. short-haul (local) freight exhibit different responses in trip efficiency in the pandemic.
	+ Differential effects of state-level emergency declarations on short-haul vs. long-haul.
	
	
Needed to answer these questions:
	- Need to calculate trips
	- Need to calculate efficiency of these trips (time required to complete a specific O-D pair)
	- Need to measure persistence of a specific spatial pattern over time (Moran's I over time, from ecology world).
