# FMI Waze Hypothesis Document



Pandemic known patterns: 
	+ Less commuter traffic by at least 50%
	+ Less congestion as a result (90% reduction in jams)
	
## Mediating variables:

- Spatial
	+ Rural Vs. Urban impacts
	+ Count of COVID cases
	
- Temporal
	+ Speed of drop in trips/trip length/volume of data; length of time of the drop; speed of rebound
	
	
## Pandemic consequences:

Overall question:

- *Did we have a more efficient transportation system duing the pandemic?*
	+ Define efficiency: Moving goods 
	+ Freight vs passenger vehicle travel
	
- *Did freight travel patterns change in the pandemic?*
	+ If no, this may indicate that there is a limit to how the structure of freight travel can be changed, even in the absense of commuter travel.

Specific questions:

- Freight transportation spatial patterns: 
	+ More direct routes? This is a testable hypothesis. Can compare with FAF as a baseline (as well as previous year FMI data)
	+ This effect may be lagged (in terms of change in directness lagging behind the change in inertia)
	+ This effect may have inertia, in terms of change in directness persisting even after commuter-driven congestion returns to pre-pandemic levels. 

- Freight transportation trip efficiency:
	+ It is possible that long-haul vs. short-haul (local) freight exhibit different responses in trip efficiency in the pandemic.
	+ Differential effects of state-level emergency declarations on short-haul vs. long-haul.
	

## What we can measure:

- Volume of trucks in a location, at a time
- Can calculate trips: length, speed, 
	+ Can then calculate efficiency of these trips (time required to complete a specific O-D pair)
	+ Can calculate measure persistence of a specific spatial pattern over time (Moran's I over time, from ecology world).
	

## Other data sets

- Transit: Can we match ridership on transit systems with congestion in Waze data?
	+ Long term telework shift

- Employment: Pattenrns will depend on type of work being done: potentially use LEHD [longtintudinal employer household data](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/) at census block level

- State actions
