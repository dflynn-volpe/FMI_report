# FMI Waze Hypothesis Document

Pandemic known patterns: 
+ Less commuter traffic by at least 50%
+ Less congestion as a result (90% reduction in jams)
	
## Broad Questions
### 1. Was the transportation system more efficient during the pandemic?
1. Has speed and congestion changed during the pandemic?
1. Have truck speeds increased and delivery routes become more direct?
1. Have freight routes become more direct?
	
### 2. Did freight travel patterns change during the pandemic? What structures in the transportation system does the pandemic response reveal?
1. Did long-haul vs last-mile freight exhibit different responses in trip efficiency during the pandemic?
1. Were there socioeconomic drivers that led to a change in waze activity or last-mile delivery during the pandemic?

## Research Question Details

### 1-1. Has speed and congestion changed during the pandemic?
##### Summary
Determine differences in waze volume compared to previous years. Compare waze volume to truck volume and truck speed. Calculate truck speeds during congestion.
##### Data sets Needed:
None
##### Action Items:
* Create metric for congestion
	* Waze volume
* Compare waze data volume to previous years
* Calculate truck volume and speed
* Correlate truck data with congestion
* Compare this congestion to the previous data
* Compare how data changes over time
##### Next Steps:
None
##### Learning Outcomes:
* How truck volume and speeds correlate to congestion and how this correlation has changed due to covid
* How truck volume, speed and congestion will change over time as states reopen
* How changes in congestion correlate with continued remote working
* If changes in congestion remain over time due to changes in work habits (ie working different times)

### 1-2. Have truck speeds increased and delivery routes become more direct?	
##### Summary
Connect individual pings from a truck to determine the route and create a metric for directness. Measure the speed of trucks. Compare this data to FAF and FMI data from the previous year as a baseline.
##### Data sets Needed:
* FAF data set
##### Action Items:
* Measure the speed of trucks
* Determine method of connecting individual pings to a truck route
* Determine metric for directness
* Compare pandemic data to baseline data
##### Next Steps:
* Get FAF data set
##### Learning Outcomes:
* How freight has changed during the pandemic and if it will this pattern will continue once traffic levels reach pre-pandemic levels again.
* If the pandemic has lasting effects on freight.

### 1-3. Have freight routes become more direct?
##### Summary:  
Connect individual pings from trucks to determine routes. Compare volume of waze data to delivery truck routes. Compare delivery frequency during the pandemic to pre-pandemic delivery routes. Correlate waze data volume with truck volume in specific areas.
##### Data sets Needed:
* Personal vehicle travel data to stores
##### Action Items:
* Connect pings from trucks to determine routes
* Create metric to determine if trucks are doing home delivery or store delivery
* Correlate delivery truck volume to waze volume
##### Next Steps:
* Find data set that shows routes from people’s homes to stores
##### Learning Outcomes:
* How delivery of goods changed during the pandemic. 
* Efficiency of home delivery trucks vs personal cars.

### 2-1. Did long-haul vs last-mile freight exhibit different responses in trip efficiency during the pandemic?	
##### Summary
Connect individual pings from a truck to determine the route. Create a metric for determining short-haul vs. long-haul. Determine volume of trucks on the road. Compare this data to previous FMI data and to FAF as baseline.
##### Data sets Needed:
* FAF
##### Action Items:
* Create metric for short-haul vs. long-haul
	* Depends on speed  and distance traveled between pings
* Calculate volume of trucks
* Calculate if these spatial patterns persist over time. 
##### Next Steps:
* Get FAF data set
* Apply metric to FAF data set
* Compare these data sets
##### Learning Outcomes:
* How short-haul and long-haul freight differ, if at all, in the way they reacted to the pandemic. Freight activity correlates with the economy. Is this reflected in both short-haul and long-haul freight?

### 2-2. Were there socioeconomic drivers that led to a change in waze activity or last-mile delivery during the pandemic?
##### Summary
Correlate change in last mile deliveries with the change in waze volume and affluence of areas. Create metric for last mile delivery of trucks. Correlate these change with affluence levels in different communities.
##### Action Items:
* Create last mile delivery metric
* Calculate volume of waze data
* Determine how persistent these last mile changes are.
##### Next Steps:
* Correlate FEHD and census data to changes in last mile delivery and waze volume data
##### Data sets Needed:
* FEHD data set on types of work
* Census data on income
##### Learning Outcomes:
* Correlation between last mile delivery changes, waze volume changes, and affluence in different areas. 
* Note that census data won’t reflect employment changes due to covid.

### Others Questions
* Is there evidence of people moving out of cities?
* Will cars be the main transportation method for personal travel?
* Did travel patterns correlate to state-level emergency declarations
* Will teleworking continue past reopening of states?
